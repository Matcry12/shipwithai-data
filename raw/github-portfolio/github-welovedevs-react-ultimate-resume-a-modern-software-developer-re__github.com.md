**react-ultimate-resume** is an open-source customizable software developer resume to highlight your skills and experiences.

Discover a modern approach of the traditional CV that includes animations and latest front-end technologies. Impress recruiters or customers with your projects, hobbies and experiences as never before.

We used JSON Resume, a community driven open source initiative to create a JSON based standard for resumes. Discover the official schema here. We added a few extra-fields to JSON Resume standard to fit developers needs. Learn more about them here.

This app is built using the popular create-react-app. You will find a lot of resources to understand how to edit and publish your resume directly on https://create-react-app.dev/

Docs can be found Here.

Feel free to improve it with a PR

The resume is designed with 10 Cards (we plan to add more !)

- 🙂 Basics: Your basics : Where are you ? When did you start coding ...
- 📊 Skills: Beautiful Graphs to show your skills
